Our C# fuel software, developed with Visual Studio and utilizing the MVC architecture and SQL backend with XAMPP, provides a solution to the long-standing issue of fuel queues in Sri Lanka. Our software generates a unique QR code and time slot for each user to book fuel, helping to reduce wait times and improve overall efficiency at fuel pump stations. With real-time updates, our software ensures that users receive up-to-date information on fuel availability and reduces the burden of waiting in long queues.
